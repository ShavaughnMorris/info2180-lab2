                        One of my favourite type of Blog is the “tech blog”.  Now this isn’t something 
                        new to blog about, as Tech bloggers have been blogging about technology 
                        news and gadget reviews in detail online since the beginning of the internet, 
                        But because it’s such a vast niche, you could carve out yourself a 
                        really good angle within the tech blog sphere.

                    <p>The trick is to have your own take on tech and don’t just follow the trend. 
                        One area which hasn’t really been covered specifically is eco tech,
                         so something to think about. Maybe a blog specifically covering tech 
                         aimed at becoming more environmentally conscious.
